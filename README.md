TITANIC DATASET - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

FILES:

• EDAtitanic.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing all code and visualizations.
• AGE DISTRIBUTION BY SURVIVAL.png – Box plot image showing age distribution by survival status.

KEY OBJECTIVES:

• Understand the structure and features of the     Titanic dataset
• Analyze survival rates across different passenger attributes
• Visualize relationships between:
• Age and survival
• Gender and survival
• Passenger class (Pclass)
• Embarkation point
• Fare and other continuous features

EDA TECHNIQUES USED:

•Missing value analysis
•Statistical summary
•Box plots
•Count plots
•Histograms and distribution plots
•Correlation heatmap

INSIGHTS:

• Women had a higher survival rate than men
• Children and upper-class passengers were more likely to survive
• Age distribution shows similar medians for survivors and non-survivors, but survivors include a wider age range

TOOLS & LIBRARIES:

•Python
•Pandas
•Matplotlib
•Seaborn
•Jupyter Notebook

DATASET:

Dataset used: Titanic dataset from Kaggle or train.csv
